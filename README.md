Build a Machine Learning web application from scratch in Python with Streamlit. We use real world data to build a machine learning model. In this first part you will see how we analyze the data and build our model.After successfully developing a machine learning model, we took the next step and created a user-friendly web application using Streamlit. To ensure the model's continued accessibility and easy deployment, we utilized Pickle for saving the model. I am excited to announce that the video showcasing the web app's functionality will be posted soon.
